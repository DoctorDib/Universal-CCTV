One way of protecting my mtorbike from bad drivers or theives!

Why I made it?
------
3rd December 2018... the day of the "strong wind". So I was minding my own business, watching Ant man and wasp until suddenly I heard my motion sensor motorbike alarm go off. I decided to look out of my window to find my motorbike balancing on a black BMW. I rushed outside to find my motoribke laying (left side up) on the floor. At the time everything was going fine, he admitted that it was his fault (with a couple of blames here and there), how he tried to shift to the left allowing the 4x4 to squeeze passed on a **SINGLE lane road**.

I recieved an email from my insurance company a couple of days later saying that the **183KG** motorbike **"blew over in adverse weather conditions"** (**12mph wind** at the time).

I came to the conclusion that I need to make some CCTV for my motorbike, to cover both theft and idiotic drivers.
